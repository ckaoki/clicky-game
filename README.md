# Clicky-Game

This is a web app game that tests the users memory by having them click on images... hopefully not more than once.
 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
1. Node.js must be installed on local machine or host. See https://nodejs.org/en/download/ for instructions.
  
### Overview

1. This application is a game which renders different images to the screen. The objective of the game is to click on every image only once.
2. Each time an image is clicked the images are randomly placed on the screen.
3. The application keeps track of the user's score, incrementing the score by 1 for every image selected for the first time.
4. The game is over if the user selects the same image more than once. In this case the images are shuffled, the score is reset to 0 and the score is recorded as the top score if it is the highest score gotten by the user.
